This is a fork of RondaStrauch/pub_strauch_etal_esurf](https://github.com/RondaStrauch/pub_strauch_etal_esurf). The code viewable from the Master branch uses Landlab-v1 and Python2.  Please change to the branch: **Landlab-v2** with Landlab component and Python3 updates that work with the Landlab Binder to launch interactive Notebooks from the original publication. 

Click here [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ChristinaB/pub_strauch_etal_esurf/landlab-v2)
to run an interactive notebook.  Once launched, select and run **Synthetic_recharge_LandlabLandslide.ipynb** from the Binder server.  The Python 3 Kernel Binder is made available to test Python 3 Version of Notebook built for Python 2 Master Branch.
